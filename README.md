# Usage
To utilize the podcast downloader script, start by launching the script in your Python environment. Upon execution, you will be prompted to input the URL of the podcast you wish to download episodes from. For instance:

`https://feeds.megaphone.fm/amelia`

Upon entering the URL, the script will analyze the podcast's feed and display a list of available MP3 files for download. You will then be asked to confirm whether you wish to proceed with the downloads.

If you choose to continue, the next step involves selecting a file naming convention from options 1 to 4. Once selected, the script initiates the download process for the chosen podcast episodes.

Should you encounter a loss of internet connection during the download process, it is necessary to manually remove any files that were partially downloaded. Upon restarting the script and selecting the same naming format as before, the download will resume from the point of interruption, ensuring a seamless continuation of the process.
