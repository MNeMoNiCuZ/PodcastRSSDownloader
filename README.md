# Usage
Launch the python script and enter the URL to the podcast, for example:

`https://feeds.megaphone.fm/amelia`

The script will attempt to list the mp3-files it can download from the podcast and ask if you want to continue.

If you do, choose the file naming format with numbers 1-4.
It should now start downloading.

If you lose connection and have to restart, manually delete any partially downloaded files, and it should continue from there as long as you chose the same name output.
